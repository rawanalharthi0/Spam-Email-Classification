# Spam-Email-Classification

• The objective of this project is to develop and assess a spam email classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Implemented in Python, the model employs the Gaussian Naive Bayes approach to determine the probability of an email being spam based on dataset features. This simple yet effective method achieved an accuracy of 85%.

• The important libraries used in this project are: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, LabelEncoder, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, RandomForestClassifier.
