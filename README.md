# Spam-Email-Classification
The objective of this project is to design and evaluate a classification model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict spam emails. The model is developed using the Python programming language and utilizes the Gaussian Naive Bayes approach to calculate the probability of an email being spam or not, based on features extracted from the dataset.

Despite the simplicity of this approach, it has proven to be highly efficient, achieving an accuracy of 85%.

The data used in this project is sourced from a spambase on Kaggle.
